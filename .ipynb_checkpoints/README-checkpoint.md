# Project 2 - Business Challenge: EDA and SQL
In this project you will experience doing an analysis using both Python and SQL to obtain the final result, by exploring each tool's behavior.

## Introduction

A data project lifecycle has many phases, rather than being just an isolated analysis in a single tool.
In this project you will experience doing an analysis using both Python and SQL to obtain the final result, by exploring each tool's behavior.

## Project Overview

### Topic
We pickup an historical sales data from 45 stores from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset). 

### DataSet Content
The Retail Data provide an historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.

## Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Provide well-documented Python code that conducts the analysis and SQL upload.
2. **SQL text file (.sql)** well commented document with all the queries answering the Business questions.
3. **Short Presentation:** Structure the presentation in the following way:
 - Intro Slides: introduce the problem and the datasets
 - Data cleaning and assumptions
 - Business questions and SQL query (1 slide per question with a print screen of the query and the answer is enough)
4. **PDF Document** with data Business Report Analysis.
