# Project 2 Business Challenge: EDA and SQL
# - Notebooks

## Overview

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks that document and execute the core processes of the **Data Analysis Project** hosted in the repository [project2-eda-sql](https://github.com/javierdastas/project2-eda-sql). These notebooks provide detailed explanations and implementations of:

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Managing and processing raw datasets for analysis.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Identifying patterns, trends, and data quality issues.
- **DataBase Data Loader:** Releational Database creation and data loader.

These processes complement the Python scripts available in the [pycode](https://github.com/javierdastas/project2-eda-sql/tree/main/pycode) folder, providing a more in-depth, step-by-step breakdown of the methodologies.

## Relation to Python Scripts

The Python scripts in the [pycode folder](https://github.com/javierdastas/project2-eda-sql/tree/main/pycode) implement similar processes but in a more streamlined and production-oriented manner. The notebooks in this folder:

- Provide detailed explanations for educational purposes.
- Allow for step-by-step debugging and analysis.
- Serve as a reference for understanding the logic implemented in the scripts.
